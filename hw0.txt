# Description of your program (part 7)
1) Prompt user to choose a document on their computer
2) Set the word counter to zero
3) Starting from the first character of the document, start analyzing each character of the doc
4) As long as the current character is not a space move onto the next character
5) If the current character happens to be a space, then add one to our word counter, then move onto the next word
6) Continue steps 3-5 until the end of the document


# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
Overall, the assignment wasn't too bad. I have some experience working with the Terminal and Git so this was a very nice review. I am just really excited to be learning Python and building projects within the context of Human-Centered Design.
